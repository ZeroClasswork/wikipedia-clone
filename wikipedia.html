                                    Writing for the album started in approximately January 2006, with Thomas Dutton writing and recording the first demo with then-guitarist Thomas Hunter. Dutton had originally envisioned the album as a side-project, without the involvement of drummer Andy
                                    Mannino and bassist Jesse Bauer.<sup><a href="#ref_7" id="7">[7]</a></sup> In the months that followed, Hunter, Mannino, and Bauer all quit the band due to personality conflicts,
                                    leaving Dutton as the sole member.<sup><a href="#ref_8" id="8">[8]</a></sup>

                                    At this point, Dutton decided the album would be released under the Forgive Durden moniker and enlisted the help of his brother Paul, a music composition major who was still in school at the time. The brothers would collaborate on weekends while Paul
                                    was still in school, with Thomas writing and demoing their ideas during the week. Thomas drew much influence from <a href="#">musical films</a> such as <a href="#">Moulin Rouge</a>,
                                    <a href="#">Newsies</a>, and many of <a href="#">Disney</a>'s animated musical films such as <a href="#">Aladdin</a>.<sup><a href="#ref_7" id="7">[7]</a></sup>

                                    Recording began in October 2007 with Rudy Gajadhar recording drums. Due to budget limitations, Thomas elected to primarily use software for the orchestral parts rather than hiring musicians. More than half of the guest vocalists were recorded in person,
                                    while the remainder of the vocalists were sent electronic files with Thomas singing their parts. The vocalists then recorded their parts and returned them electronically.<sup><a href="#">[7]</a></sup>

                                    Recording was finished in July 2008. The album artwork was created by Blaine Fontana. In addition to the standard version, a limited deluxe edition of the album was also available; including the album in a <a href="#">DVD</a>-sized
                                    case with a copy of the full script and artwork.<sup><a href="#ref_9" id="9">[9]</a></sup>

                                    as fiction. Tired of his brother's attitude, Pallis says that, if Adakias leaves, he will hunt him down and make him suffer the consequences. While Adakias tries to convince him that his feelings could be tied to his

                                        "The End and the Beginning" (featuring Greta Salpeter and Brendon Urie):
                                    </strong> Resolved to force Adakias back to his old life, Pallis reveals to the Princess that Adakias is from the Dark. Adakias explains to Anhura that he wanted to tell her and that
                                    this new information should not change their love. Pallis, furious that the revelation has not affected their love, lunges at Anhura with a dagger. Adakias, however, trying to protect the Princess, is stabbed. Pallis
                                    immediately regrets his actions and repents for not seeing his brother as the chosen one to fulfill the prophecy. Adakias, before dying, forgives him and tells Pallis and Anhura that his gift to them is to "Live for
                                    your love everyday." The story complete, the Narrator tells how the mountain disappears and the two halves of the world finally reunite, implying that Pallis and Anhura mutually combined the kingdoms in Adakias' honor
                                    . He ends his narration telling who is listening to pass on the story to other people and to never stop believing in love and hope.
